### Plugin API

Slack plugin works after the bot token is specified to the settings. The token can be generated by:

1. Log in to your slack team in your browser.
2. Access **https://[Your Team].slack.com/apps/A0F7YS25R-bots**
3. Click 'Add Configuration' link
4. Set bot name (We recommend 'nanogw-[NanoGW Place]') and click 'Add Bot Integration'
5. The token is shown in Integration Settings => API Token. Copy-paste it to NanoGW plugin's setting.
6. Add this bot to your favorite channel(s).

### GET|POST /v1/slack/post
with the parameter **text** to post to slack

### SUB /v1/slack/[free string]

If there is a mention or a private message to this bot, the first word is recognized as a command and any following string becomes the parameter.  
For example, if the API client subscribes **/v1/slack/hello**, a string is published when there is a mention such as **@nanogw-bot hello slack!**
